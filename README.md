# HTML-JS-CSS
Portfolio
This is my portfolio for HTML , CSS , JS! Look to choose the first 3 files(sometimes it might be 2 or only 1 file) 
Then put them in 1 folder and you should be ready! 
Some projects may have some flaws or be copied online , but i started from 0 and learned a lot as 15 year old. 
I wasnt forced to do this so the methods I use may be a little diffrent. I hope this helps for my future and enjoy!
